# Note the following properties of binary trees when represented as lists
# Let i represent the counting position, starting from 1 (i.e. index + 1),
# and n represent the length of the list:
# 1. Parent Node
#      a. if i == 1, then node i has no parent node (it is the root)
#      b. if i > 1, then the parent node of i is node (i // 2)
# 2. Left Child Node
#      a. if 2i > n, then node i has no left child
#      b. if 2i <= n, then the left child of node i is node 2i
# 3. Right Child Node
#      a. if 2i + 1 > n, then node i has no right child
#      b. if 2i + 1 <= n, then the right child of node i is node 2i
# 4. Left Sibling
#      a. if i > 1 is odd, then the left sibling of node i is node i - 1
# 5. Right Sibling
#      a. if i < n is even, then the right sibling of node i is node i + 1
# 6. Level of a Node
#      a. the root node is level 1
#      b. the level of node i = floor( log2(i) ) + 1
