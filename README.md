# algorithms

This is a collection of files I created with no particular purpose.

Instead, they represent me working through learning how to code
different algorithms **for the first time** as I learn them.
Therefore, the implementations are for the most part not optimized.

Additional files represent any other leads my brain decided to chase
down throughought my studies, such as a Plotly graph to compare the
runtimes of the 3 different sorting algorithms I initially learned.
