# algorithms

This is a collection of files I created with no particular purpose.

Instead, they represent me working through learning how to code
different algorithms **for the first time** as I learn them.
Therefore, the implementations are for the most part not optimized.

Also included are my solutions to any interesting leetcode or hackerrank
problems that I solve, either for fun, interview prep, or to advance my
understanding of different of these algorithms.

Finally, there are a few additional files from any other leads my brain
decided to chase down during my studies, such as comparison_sorting.png:
a Plotly graph to compare the run times of the 3 different sorting
algorithms I initially learned (insertion sort, bubble sort, and merge
sort); or a file to practice using new data structures: linked_list.py.

Take a closer look at your own risk. Hope you enjoy.
