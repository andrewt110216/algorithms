# Algorithms & Data Structures

This is a collection of files I created while learning data structures and algorithms, and solving leetcode and hackerrank problems.

The files represent me working through learning how to code different algorithms **for the first time** as I learn them, and therefore, the implementations may not be fully optimized.

Finally, there are a few additional files from any other leads my brain decided to chase down during my studies, such as comparison_sorting.png: a Plotly graph to compare the run times of the 3 different sorting algorithms I initially learned (insertion sort, bubble sort, and merge sort); or a file to practice using linked lists: linked_list.py.

Hope you enjoy.
